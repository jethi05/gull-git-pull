# gull-git-pull
I really hate it, that I have to pull every repo by it's own, I always forget
it and then I've got a problem, so because ive got an folder, called development,
where I'Ve got all my projects I will just make a Bash scricpt that will run when
I start one of my PC's. I also want to add a ` conf ` file, where I can also
give other specific direcotrys which should get pulled too.
## Ta-da's
- rename conf into gull.conf at the end
